            <strong>Explore by Objective:</strong> Start by selecting a policy objective from the 
            sidebar to see which tools can help achieve that goal. Each objective page shows 
            related tools and their effectiveness.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Browse Tools:</strong> Alternatively, explore individual policy tools to 
            understand their mechanisms, effectiveness, and optimal conditions for use.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Use Filters:</strong> Apply filters by innovation stage, sector, delivery 
            mechanism, targeting approach, or timeline to narrow down relevant tools for your 
            specific context.

          <p>
            <strong>Innovation Stage:</strong> Whether the tool supports early-stage research, 
            applied research, development, demonstration, or deployment phases.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sectors:</strong> Industry focus areas including manufacturing, ICT, 
            life sciences, energy, and cross-sector applications.

            and grants to procurement and innovation vouchers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Targeting:</strong> Whether the tool is broad-based, sector-specific, 
            technology-specific, regional, or focused on particular firm sizes.

          <p>
            Effective innovation policy typically combines multiple tools working together. 
            Consider these principles when selecting tools:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Policy Mix:</strong> Use complementary tools that address different 
            aspects of the innovation process rather than relying on single instruments.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Context Matters:</strong> Consider your specific economic, institutional, 
            and technological context when selecting tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Implementation Capacity:</strong> Assess your organization's ability to 
            implement and manage different types of tools effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Timeline Alignment:</strong> Match tool selection to your policy timeline, 
            balancing immediate needs with long-term innovation goals.
